     My name is Vince Deutschmann. I am originally from St.Louis but I now live in Columbia. I am a sophomore pursuing a degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering at the University of Missouri. I have also played racquetball for 6 years and am the Vice President of the Mizzou Club Racquetball team. I travel all across the country to places like Phoenix, Columbus, Des Moines, and Portland playing in tournaments with the team. I work as an IT consultant which consists of computer tech support, AV and security system installations, and networking. I also own a mobile detailing company based in St.Louis where I manage a team that details cars, boats, and planes. In my free time I like to workout, watch movies, and listen to music. Some of my favorite movies are Whiplash, La La Land, and Baby Driver. A few of my favorite artists are Daniel Caeser, Kanye West, and Juice WRLD.
