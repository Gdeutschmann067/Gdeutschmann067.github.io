                    I am very proud of all that I have achieved so far and am looking forward to the future. I have
                    thrived
                    academically, earning a curator scholar award, and making the dean's list. My coursework has prepped
                    me
                    for any future career that I would pursue. My experience as an IT Consultant has been great in
                    applying
                    myself and allowing me to grow.
                </p>

                <p id="bio2">
                    As a young entrepreneur I have faced many challenges which has set me up for success in the future.
                    As I
                    expand my scope of knowledge I hope to use the things I learn to start another company later on.
                    Since I
                    am paying my own way through college sometimes it gets stressful. My detailing company allows me to
                    have
                    the freedom to focus on school and not have to worry about working as much.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="bio3">
                    Looking ahead, I plan to graduate in spring 2026 and pursue a career involving computer and
                    electrical
                    engineering. The main aspects I hope to work in with this degree are Software development and
                    something
                    involving AI. My goal is to contribute to tech by using my skills. I am excited to get my first
                    internship soon and make an impact on my field of interest. I also look forward to working on large
                    projects that allow me to apply myself.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p id="bio4">
                    In summary, my school and work experience has shaped my life significantly. All these experiences
                    have
                    prepared me for the challenges that I will face in the workplace and in my future studies. I look
                    forward to all the new experiences I will encounter in the years ahead.
