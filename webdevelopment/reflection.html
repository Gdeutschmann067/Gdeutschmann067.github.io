            I am very proud of all that I have achieved so far and am looking forward to the future. I have thrived academically, earning a curator scholar award, and making the dean's list. My coursework has prepped me for any future career that I would pursue. My  experience as an IT Consultant has been great in applying myself and allowing me to grow.

As a young entrepreneur I have faced many challenges which has set me up for success in the future. As I expand my scope of knowledge I hope to use the things I learn to start another company later on. Since I am paying my own way through college sometimes it gets stressful. My detailing company allows me to have the freedom to focus on school and not have to worry about working as much. 
</p>

<p id="bio">
Looking ahead, I plan to graduate in spring 2026 and pursue a career involving computer and electrical engineering. The main aspects I hope to work in with this degree are Software development and something involving AI. My goal is to contribute to tech by using my skills. I am excited to get my first internship soon and make an impact on my field of interest. I also look forward to working on large projects that allow me to apply myself. 
</p>
<br>
<p id="bio">
In summary, my school and work experience has shaped my life significantly. All these experiences have prepared me for the challenges that I will face in the workplace and in my future studies. I look forward to all the new experiences I will encounter in the years ahead.
